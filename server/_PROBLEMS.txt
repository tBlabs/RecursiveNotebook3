WARNING!

`npm i --prefix server` is not working!

    The only way to solve this problem is to copy node_modules to server after `npm i`.



typescript must be installed globaly!

    Otherwise types/mongodb throws errors during compilation.



server/bin can not be in .gitignore

    Heroku is not able to build typescript code without typescript globally installed!
    There is too much work to do it manually.



^U heroku
    +b - bash
    +d - deploy
    +f - fastdeploy

^H - host/server
^L - client commands
    +b - build
    +r - run
    +t - test
    +c - clean
